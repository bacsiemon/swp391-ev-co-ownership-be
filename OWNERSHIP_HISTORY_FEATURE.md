# üìä Ownership History Feature Documentation

## Overview

The **Ownership History** feature provides comprehensive audit trail and historical tracking capabilities for vehicle ownership changes in the EV Co-Ownership system. It automatically records all ownership modifications and provides various query endpoints to view the evolution of ownership over time.

## üéØ Key Features

1. **Automatic History Recording** - Every approved ownership change is automatically logged
2. **Timeline View** - See how ownership evolved over time for all co-owners
3. **Historical Snapshots** - Reconstruct ownership distribution at any past date
4. **Statistics & Analytics** - Get aggregated metrics about ownership changes
5. **Personal History** - Track individual co-owner's ownership across all vehicles
6. **Comprehensive Filtering** - Filter history by date range, change type, or specific co-owner

## üóÇÔ∏è Architecture

### Database Schema

#### `ownership_history` Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE ownership_history (
    id                              SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    vehicle_id                      INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES vehicles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    co_owner_id                     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES co_owners(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    user_id                         INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    ownership_change_request_id     INTEGER REFERENCES ownership_change_requests(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
    
    -- Previous State
    previous_percentage             NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
    previous_investment             NUMERIC(15,2) NOT NULL,
    
    -- New State
    new_percentage                  NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
    new_investment                  NUMERIC(15,2) NOT NULL,
    
    -- Calculated Changes
    percentage_change               NUMERIC(5,2) NOT NULL,
    investment_change               NUMERIC(15,2) NOT NULL,
    
    -- Metadata
    change_type_enum                INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- EOwnershipChangeType
    reason                          VARCHAR(1000),
    changed_by_user_id              INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    created_at                      TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_ownership_history_vehicle_id ON ownership_history(vehicle_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ownership_history_co_owner_id ON ownership_history(co_owner_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ownership_history_user_id ON ownership_history(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_ownership_history_created_at ON ownership_history(created_at);
```

### Change Types (EOwnershipChangeType)

| Value | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | Initial | Initial ownership assignment when vehicle is created |
| 1 | Adjustment | Ownership percentage adjustment among existing co-owners |
| 2 | Transfer | Ownership transferred from one co-owner to another |
| 3 | Exit | Co-owner exits and ownership redistributed |
| 4 | NewMember | New co-owner joins and ownership redistributed |
| 5 | AdminAdjustment | Administrative adjustment by system admin |

## üîÑ How It Works

### Automatic Recording Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API
    participant Service
    participant Database
    
    User->>API: Approve Ownership Change
    API->>Service: ApproveOrRejectOwnershipChangeAsync()
    Service->>Service: All approvals received?
    Service->>Service: ApplyOwnershipChangesAsync()
    
    loop For each OwnershipChangeDetail
        Service->>Database: Create OwnershipHistory record
        Note right of Database: Stores: previous‚Üínew<br/>percentage, investment,<br/>change type, reason
        Service->>Database: Update VehicleCoOwner
    end
    
    Service-->>API: Success
    API-->>User: Ownership changed + history recorded
```

### History Creation Logic

When `ApplyOwnershipChangesAsync` is called (after all approvals received):

```csharp
foreach (var detail in ownershipChangeDetails)
{
    // Create history record
    var historyRecord = new OwnershipHistory
    {
        VehicleId = changeRequest.VehicleId,
        CoOwnerId = detail.CoOwnerId,
        UserId = detail.CoOwner.UserId,
        OwnershipChangeRequestId = changeRequest.Id,
        
        // Before state
        PreviousPercentage = detail.CurrentPercentage,
        PreviousInvestment = detail.CurrentInvestment,
        
        // After state
        NewPercentage = detail.ProposedPercentage,
        NewInvestment = detail.ProposedInvestment,
        
        // Calculated changes
        PercentageChange = detail.ProposedPercentage - detail.CurrentPercentage,
        InvestmentChange = detail.ProposedInvestment - detail.CurrentInvestment,
        
        // Metadata
        ChangeTypeEnum = EOwnershipChangeType.Adjustment,
        Reason = changeRequest.Reason,
        ChangedByUserId = changeRequest.ProposedByUserId,
        CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow
    };
    
    _unitOfWork.DbContext.Set<OwnershipHistory>().Add(historyRecord);
    
    // Update actual ownership
    vehicleCoOwner.OwnershipPercentage = detail.ProposedPercentage;
    vehicleCoOwner.InvestmentAmount = detail.ProposedInvestment;
}

await _unitOfWork.SaveChangesAsync();
```

```

### 2. Ownership Evolution Visualization
**Scenario**: Display ownership changes over time in a timeline chart
```http
GET /api/ownershiphistory/vehicle/1/timeline
```

### 3. Historical Verification
**Scenario**: User claims they owned 50% on Jan 1, 2024
```http
GET /api/ownershiphistory/vehicle/1/snapshot?date=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z
```

### 4. Analytics Dashboard
**Scenario**: Show vehicle ownership change statistics
```http
GET /api/ownershiphistory/vehicle/1/statistics

```http
GET /api/ownershiphistory/vehicle/1?startDate=2024-01-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-03-31T23:59:59Z
```

### 7. Filter by Change Type
**Scenario**: View only ownership adjustments (not transfers or exits)
```http
GET /api/ownershiphistory/vehicle/1?changeType=Adjustment
```

## üß™ Testing

### 1. Test Automatic Recording
1. Create an ownership change request
2. All co-owners approve it
3. Check database: `SELECT * FROM ownership_history WHERE vehicle_id = 1`
4. Verify: One record per affected co-owner created

### 2. Test Timeline View
1. Create multiple ownership changes over time
2. Call timeline endpoint
3. Verify: All changes listed chronologically, grouped by co-owner

### 3. Test Snapshot
1. Record current ownership
2. Make ownership changes
3. Query snapshot at date before changes
4. Verify: Snapshot shows old ownership distribution

### 4. Test Statistics
1. Create various ownership changes (different types)
2. Call statistics endpoint
3. Verify: Counts, date ranges, and breakdown match actual data

### 5. Test Personal History
1. User is co-owner of multiple vehicles
2. Create ownership changes in different vehicles
3. Call `/my-history`
4. Verify: Returns history from all vehicles

## üîÑ Integration with Ownership Change Feature

The history feature is **tightly integrated** with the ownership change approval system:

```
Ownership Change Flow:
1. User proposes ownership change
2. All co-owners receive approval requests
3. Each co-owner approves/rejects
4. If all approve ‚Üí ApplyOwnershipChangesAsync()
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Create OwnershipHistory records (1 per affected co-owner)
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Update VehicleCoOwner percentages/investments
5. Ownership changed + audit trail created
```

**Key Point**: History records are created **automatically** when ownership changes are applied. No manual intervention required.

## üìà Performance Considerations

### Indexes
- `vehicle_id`: Fast lookup for vehicle history
- `co_owner_id`: Fast lookup for co-owner history
- `user_id`: Fast lookup for user history
- `created_at`: Fast date range queries

### Pagination
- Default limit: 50 records
- Recommended: Use `offset` and `limit` for large datasets
- Statistics endpoint: No pagination (aggregates all data)

### Query Optimization
- **Timeline**: Uses single query with `Include()` for relationships
- **Snapshot**: Reconstructs state from history up to date (efficient with indexes)
- **Statistics**: Aggregates in-memory after loading history (consider caching for high traffic)

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

1. **Export History** - Export ownership history to CSV/PDF
2. **Change Notifications** - Real-time notifications when ownership changes
3. **Comparison Tool** - Compare ownership at two different dates
4. **Ownership Forecast** - Predict future ownership based on trends
5. **Graphical Timeline** - Visual timeline chart in frontend
6. **Reversal Support** - Roll back ownership changes (with admin approval)
7. **Bulk Changes** - Support importing ownership changes from CSV
8. **Change Reasons Library** - Predefined reasons for common ownership changes

## ‚úÖ Validation & Business Rules

1. **Authorization**:
   - Only co-owners can view vehicle history
   - Any co-owner can view full vehicle history
   - Personal history only shows user's own records

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - History records are **immutable** (no updates allowed)
   - Cascade delete: When vehicle deleted, history deleted
   - Soft delete on ownership change request: History preserved

3. **Snapshot Logic**:
   - If no history before snapshot date: Use current ownership
   - Only include co-owners who existed at snapshot date
   - Total percentage should always sum to 100%

4. **Statistics Calculation**:
   - Averages based on current co-owners only
   - Change type breakdown includes all types, even if count is 0

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Use Timeline for Visualization** - Timeline endpoint provides structured data perfect for chart libraries
2. **Cache Statistics** - Statistics are expensive; cache for 5-10 minutes if high traffic
3. **Filter Aggressively** - Use date filters to reduce data transfer
4. **Audit Trail Retention** - Consider archiving old history records after X years
5. **Monitor Performance** - Watch query times on large datasets (>10,000 records)
