# SignalR Notification System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive SignalR notification system for the EV Co-Ownership project with real-time notification delivery, event-driven architecture, and full CRUD operations.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Data Models & DTOs
**Location:** `EvCoOwnership.DTOs/Notifications/`
- `CreateNotificationRequestDto` - For creating notifications to multiple users
- `SendNotificationRequestDto` - For admin to send notifications to specific users
- `NotificationResponseDto` - Response format for notification data
- `MarkNotificationReadRequestDto` - For marking notifications as read
- `NotificationEventData` - Event data for internal communication

### 2. Repository Layer
**Location:** `EvCoOwnership.Repositories/`
- `INotificationRepository` - Interface for notification CRUD operations
- `IUserNotificationRepository` - Interface for user-notification relationship operations
- `NotificationRepository` - Implementation with create, read, delete operations
- `UserNotificationRepository` - Implementation with pagination, bulk operations, and read status management
- Updated `UnitOfWork` to include both new repositories

### 3. Service Layer
**Location:** `EvCoOwnership.Services/`
- `INotificationService` - Service interface with 7 main methods
- `NotificationService` - Full implementation with business logic
- `NotificationEventPublisher` - Static event publisher for cross-layer communication
- Two main service methods:
  - `SendNotificationToUsersAsync()` - Send to multiple users
  - `SendNotificationToUserAsync()` - Send to single user
- Event listener functionality through static event publisher

### 4. SignalR Hub
**Location:** `EvCoOwnership.API/Hubs/`
- `INotificationClient` - Strongly typed interface for client methods
- `NotificationHub` - Hub implementation with 4 client methods:
  - `MarkNotificationAsRead()`
  - `MarkMultipleNotificationsAsRead()`
  - `MarkAllNotificationsAsRead()`
  - `GetUnreadCount()`
- Automatic user grouping and connection management
- JWT authentication required

### 5. Middleware
**Location:** `EvCoOwnership.API/Middlewares/`
- `NotificationMiddleware` - Listens to service events and broadcasts via SignalR
- Automatic event-to-SignalR bridging
- User-specific group messaging
- Priority detection based on notification type

### 6. Controller Endpoints
**Location:** `EvCoOwnership.API/Controllers/NotificationController.cs`
- `GET /api/notification/my-notifications` - Get paginated notifications (User/Admin)
- `GET /api/notification/unread-count` - Get unread count (User/Admin)
- `PUT /api/notification/mark-read/{id}` - Mark single as read (User/Admin)
- `PUT /api/notification/mark-multiple-read` - Mark multiple as read (User/Admin)
- `PUT /api/notification/mark-all-read` - Mark all as read (User/Admin)
- `POST /api/notification/send-to-user` - Manual send to user (Admin only)
- `POST /api/notification/create-notification` - Create bulk notification (Admin only)

### 7. Configuration & Setup
- Added SignalR to `ApiConfigurations.cs`
- Updated `ServiceConfigurations.cs` with notification service
- Added hub mapping to `Program.cs`
- Integrated notification middleware in pipeline
- Updated project references for DTOs

## Key Features

### Real-time Communication
- Instant notification delivery via SignalR
- User-specific notification channels
- Automatic connection management
- Unread count updates in real-time

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Decoupled service-to-hub communication
- Static event publisher pattern
- Automatic SignalR broadcasting on service events
- Cross-layer event handling

### Security & Authorization
- JWT authentication for hub connections
- Role-based authorization for admin endpoints
- User-specific data access controls
- Secure user ID extraction from claims

### Scalability Features
- Pagination support for notification lists
- Bulk operations for marking as read
- Efficient database queries with includes
- Lazy loading in UnitOfWork pattern

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Structured logging with Serilog
- Graceful error responses
- Validation with FluentValidation

## Usage Examples

### For Other Services to Send Notifications:
```csharp
// Inject INotificationService in your service
await _notificationService.SendNotificationToUserAsync(
    userId: 123,
    notificationType: "Vehicle Booking Approved", 
    priority: ESeverityType.Medium,
    additionalData: "{\"bookingId\": 456}"
);
```

### Client-Side SignalR Connection:
```javascript
// Connect to hub
const connection = new signalR.HubConnectionBuilder()
    .withUrl("/notificationHub", { accessTokenFactory: () => bearerToken })
    .build();

// Listen for notifications
connection.on("ReceiveNotification", function (notification) {
    console.log("New notification:", notification);
});

// Mark notification as read
connection.invoke("MarkNotificationAsRead", notificationId);
```

### API Consumption:
```javascript
// Get notifications with pagination
GET /api/notification/my-notifications?pageIndex=1&pageSize=10&includeRead=true

// Admin sending notification
POST /api/notification/send-to-user
{
  "userId": 123,
  "message": "Your booking was approved",
  "notificationType": "Booking Approval"
}
```

## Database Schema
The system uses existing entities:
- `NotificationEntity` - Core notification data
- `UserNotification` - User-notification relationship with read status
- Leverages existing `User` table for relationships

## SignalR Hub Endpoint
- **Hub URL:** `/notificationHub`
- **Authentication:** JWT Bearer token required
- **Groups:** Users automatically joined to `User_{userId}` groups
- **Methods:** 4 client-callable methods for notification management
