ERD for EV Co-Ownership System
==============================

[This is a placeholder for the ERD image.]

To generate the ERD:
- Use a tool like dbdiagram.io, dbdesigner.net, or draw.io
- Import the schema from `master_schema.sql` or use the table/relationship list in `DATABASE_MASTER_DESIGN.md`
- Ensure all PKs, FKs, and relationships are visually clear
- Save/export the diagram as `ERD_Main.png` and place it in the project root

**Diagram should include:**
- All tables as boxes with fields
- PKs and FKs clearly marked
- Relationship lines/arrows (1-1, 1-N, N-N)
- Composite keys and junction tables (e.g., VehicleCoOwner, FundUsageVote)
- Color or grouping for major modules (User, Vehicle, Fund, Booking, etc.)

*Once the ERD is created, replace this file with the actual PNG image.*
