## üßÆ Calculation Logic

### Fairness Score Calculation
```csharp
FairnessScore = 100 - (UsageVsOwnershipDelta * ScaleFactor)

Where:
- Delta ‚â§ 5%:  Score = 100 (Excellent)
- Delta ‚â§ 10%: Score = 85  (Good)
- Delta ‚â§ 15%: Score = 70  (Fair)
- Delta ‚â§ 20%: Score = 55  (Poor)
- Delta > 20%: Score = 40 or less (Critical)
```

### Usage Pattern Classification
```csharp
Pattern Classification:
- Balanced:      |Delta| ‚â§ 5%
- Overutilized:  Delta > 5%
- Underutilized: Delta < -5%

Where Delta = AverageUsagePercentage - OwnershipPercentage
```

### Cost Adjustment Calculation
```csharp
ExpectedCostShare = TotalCost √ó (OwnershipPercentage / 100)
ActualCostShare = TotalCost √ó (AverageUsagePercentage / 100)
CostAdjustmentNeeded = ActualCostShare - ExpectedCostShare
```

### Schedule Conflict Probability
```csharp
ConflictProbability = SimilarBookingsCount / TotalSimilarPeriods

Where:
- SimilarBookings: Same day of week, ¬±2 hours time window
- LowRisk:    Probability < 0.3
- MediumRisk: Probability 0.3 - 0.6
- HighRisk:   Probability > 0.6
```

### Vehicle Health Score
```csharp
BaseScore = 100
- Deduct 20 points if no maintenance > 6 months
- Deduct 15 points if distance > 10,000 km since last service
- Deduct 10 points per health issue detected

HealthStatus = Score >= 90 ? "Excellent"
             : Score >= 75 ? "Good"
             : Score >= 60 ? "Fair"
             : "Poor"
```

### Fund Optimization Thresholds
```csharp
RecommendedMinimum = AverageMonthlyExpense √ó 2
RecommendedOptimal = AverageMonthlyExpense √ó 3

IsUnderfunded = CurrentBalance < RecommendedMinimum
IsOverfunded  = CurrentBalance > RecommendedOptimal √ó 2
```

## üìà Use Cases

GET /api/fairnessoptimization/vehicle/1/fairness-report
    ?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-10-23

// Step 2: Review fairness score and co-owner details
// - Overall score: 70 (Fair)
// - John: 40% ownership, 55.8% usage (Overutilized +15.8%)
// - Jane: 60% ownership, 44.2% usage (Underutilized -15.8%)

// Step 3: Follow recommendations
// - Schedule meeting to discuss usage patterns
// - Implement booking rotation
// - Adjust cost sharing: John pays extra 1,583,000 VND
```

### Use Case 2: Planning Fair Future Bookings
**Scenario**: Co-owners want to plan next month fairly

```javascript
// Step 1: Get schedule suggestions
GET /api/fairnessoptimization/vehicle/1/schedule-suggestions
    ?startDate=2024-11-01&endDate=2024-11-30
    &preferredDurationHours=4

// Step 2: Review personalized suggestions
// - John (40% ownership, 25% current usage):
//   ‚Üí 5 suggested bookings (20 hours total)
//   ‚Üí Low-conflict Tuesday mornings
//   ‚Üí Rationale: "Underutilizing by 15%, increase usage"

// Step 3: Book suggested slots
// - Low conflict probability (15-20%)
// - Optimal times based on historical data
// - Achieves balanced usage distribution
```

### Use Case 3: Preventive Maintenance Planning
**Scenario**: Plan maintenance to avoid breakdowns

```javascript
// Step 1: Get maintenance suggestions
GET /api/fairnessoptimization/vehicle/1/maintenance-suggestions
    ?includePredictive=true&lookaheadDays=60

// Step 2: Review health status
// - Current odometer: 45,000 km
// - Health score: 82/100 (Good)
// - 125 days since last service

// Step 3: Schedule recommended maintenance
// Priority 1 (High): Annual inspection (30 days)
// Priority 2 (Medium): Tire rotation (14 days)
// Priority 3 (Medium): Battery check (7 days)

// Step 4: Budget for costs
// - Total forecast (60 days): 2,800,000 VND
// - Per co-owner: 1,400,000 VND
// - Preventive savings: 500,000 VND
```

### Use Case 4: Reducing Monthly Costs
**Scenario**: Co-owners want to reduce expenses

```javascript
// Step 1: Analyze costs
GET /api/fairnessoptimization/vehicle/1/cost-saving-recommendations
    ?analysisPeriodDays=90

// Step 2: Review cost analysis
// - Total costs (90 days): 15,000,000 VND
// - Breakdown: 66.7% routine, 33.3% reactive
// - Potential savings: 4,500,000 VND (30%)

// Step 3: Implement high-priority recommendations
// 1. Switch to preventive schedule (saves 3,000,000 VND)
// 2. Optimize charging costs (saves 750,000 VND)
// 3. Increase fund balance (avoid emergency costs)

// Step 4: Track improvements
// - Target: 40% preventive ratio ‚Üí saves 2,000,000 VND
// - Establish maintenance schedule
// - Monitor costs monthly
```

## üöÄ Integration Guide

### React Component Example
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Chart } from 'chart.js';

function FairnessOverview({ vehicleId }) {
  const [report, setReport] = useState(null);
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch fairness report
    fetch(`/api/fairnessoptimization/vehicle/${vehicleId}/fairness-report`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setReport(data.data));

    // Fetch maintenance suggestions
    fetch(`/api/fairnessoptimization/vehicle/${vehicleId}/maintenance-suggestions`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setSuggestions(data.data));
  }, [vehicleId]);

  if (!report) return <Loading />;

  return (
    <div className="fairness-dashboard">
      {/* Fairness Score Card */}
      <ScoreCard
        title="Fairness Score"
        score={report.overview.fairnessScore}
        status={report.overview.overallFairnessStatus}
        color={getScoreColor(report.overview.fairnessScore)}
      />

      {/* Co-Owners Comparison Chart */}
      <BarChart
        data={report.coOwnersDetails.map(co => ({
          name: co.coOwnerName,
          ownership: co.ownershipPercentage,
          usage: co.averageUsagePercentage
        }))}

      />

      {/* Maintenance Alerts */}
      {suggestions?.suggestions.filter(s => s.urgency === 'High').map(alert => (
        <Alert
          key={alert.title}
          type="warning"
          title={alert.title}
          description={alert.description}
          actions={alert.benefits}

}
```

### Chart.js Visualization
```javascript
// Fairness comparison chart
function createFairnessChart(coOwnersData) {
  const ctx = document.getElementById('fairnessChart');
  
  new Chart(ctx, {
    type: 'bar',
    data: {
      labels: coOwnersData.map(co => co.coOwnerName),
      datasets: [
        {
          label: 'Ownership %',
          data: coOwnersData.map(co => co.ownershipPercentage),
          backgroundColor: '#3498db'
        },
        {
          label: 'Usage %',
          data: coOwnersData.map(co => co.averageUsagePercentage),
          backgroundColor: coOwnersData.map(co => 
            co.usagePattern === 'Balanced' ? '#2ecc71' :
            co.usagePattern === 'Overutilized' ? '#e74c3c' : '#f39c12'
          )
        }
      ]
    },
    options: {
      responsive: true,
      plugins: {
        title: {
          display: true,
          text: 'Usage vs Ownership Comparison'
        },
        tooltip: {
          callbacks: {
            afterLabel: (context) => {
              const index = context.dataIndex;
              const co = coOwnersData[index];
              return `Pattern: ${co.usagePattern}\nDelta: ${co.usageVsOwnershipDelta.toFixed(1)}%`;
            }
          }
        }
      },
      scales: {
        y: {
          beginAtZero: true,
          max: 100,
          title: { display: true, text: 'Percentage (%)' }
        }
      }
    }
  });
}
```

## üîê Authorization

All endpoints require:
- **Authentication**: Bearer JWT token
- **Role**: CoOwner
- **Ownership Verification**: User must be active co-owner of vehicle

**Error Responses:**
- `403 NOT_AUTHORIZED_TO_VIEW_VEHICLE_FAIRNESS_REPORT`
- `403 NOT_AUTHORIZED_TO_VIEW_SCHEDULE_SUGGESTIONS`
- `403 NOT_AUTHORIZED_TO_VIEW_MAINTENANCE_SUGGESTIONS`
- `403 NOT_AUTHORIZED_TO_VIEW_COST_RECOMMENDATIONS`
- `404 VEHICLE_NOT_FOUND`

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- **Eager Loading**: Uses `Include()` for related entities (Bookings, CheckIns, CheckOuts, MaintenanceCosts, VehicleConditions)
- **Selective Queries**: Only loads active co-owners and relevant date ranges
- **Efficient Aggregations**: Uses LINQ Sum/Average for calculations

### Caching Strategy
```csharp
// Recommended caching durations
[ResponseCache(Duration = 600)]  // Fairness Report: 10 minutes
[ResponseCache(Duration = 900)]  // Schedule Suggestions: 15 minutes
[ResponseCache(Duration = 1800)] // Maintenance: 30 minutes
[ResponseCache(Duration = 3600)] // Cost Recommendations: 1 hour
```

### Large Datasets
- **Pagination**: Not needed (limited by vehicle co-owners count, typically < 10)
- **Date Filtering**: Always use date ranges to limit booking queries
- **Aggregation First**: Calculate totals before detailed processing

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### For Co-Owners
1. **Regular Monitoring**: Check fairness report monthly
2. **Act on Recommendations**: Implement high-priority suggestions
3. **Communicate**: Discuss imbalances with other co-owners
4. **Plan Ahead**: Use schedule suggestions for next month
5. **Preventive Maintenance**: Follow maintenance calendar

### For Developers
1. **Validate Inputs**: Use FluentValidation for request parameters
2. **Error Handling**: Return appropriate status codes and messages
3. **Authorization**: Always verify co-owner access
4. **Logging**: Log analysis requests and recommendation generation
5. **Testing**: Unit test calculation logic thoroughly

### For System Administrators
1. **Monitor API Usage**: Track endpoint call frequency
2. **Database Indices**: Ensure proper indexing on Booking.StartTime, MaintenanceCost.CreatedAt
3. **Cache Configuration**: Adjust cache durations based on usage patterns
4. **Alert Thresholds**: Set up alerts for low fund balances, overdue maintenance
