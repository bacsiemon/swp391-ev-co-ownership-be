# Ownership Change Feature Documentation

## üìã Overview

The **Ownership Change** feature allows co-owners to propose and approve changes to vehicle ownership percentages through a **group consensus mechanism**. All affected co-owners must approve before changes take effect, ensuring democratic decision-making in the EV co-ownership system.

## üéØ Key Features

### 1. **Propose Ownership Changes**
- Any co-owner can propose ownership percentage adjustments
- Must include all current co-owners in the proposal
- Total ownership must equal exactly 100%
- Only one pending request allowed per vehicle

### 2. **Group Consensus Approval**
- All co-owners must approve before changes apply
- Any single rejection blocks the change
- Real-time notifications to all parties
- Transparent approval tracking

### 3. **Automatic Application**
- Changes auto-apply when all approvals received
- Database updates ownership percentages
- Investment amounts can be adjusted
- Audit trail maintained

### 4. **Request Management**
- View pending approvals
- Track approval status
- Cancel pending requests (proposer only)
- Historical request tracking

### 5. **Admin Monitoring**
- System-wide statistics
- Average approval time metrics
- Request status breakdown

---

## üíº Business Logic

### **Ownership Change Workflow**

```
1. Co-owner proposes change
   ‚Üì
2. System validates:
   - User is co-owner
   - All co-owners included
   - Total = 100%
   - No pending requests
   ‚Üì
3. Create request + approval records
   ‚Üì
4. Notify all co-owners (except proposer)
   ‚Üì
5. Co-owners respond (Approve/Reject)
   ‚Üì
6a. ANY Rejection ‚Üí Request rejected
   ‚Üì
6b. ALL Approvals ‚Üí Changes applied to VehicleCoOwner table
   ‚Üì
7. Notify all co-owners of result
```

### **Validation Rules**

**Proposal:**
- ‚úÖ Proposer must be co-owner
- ‚úÖ All current co-owners included
- ‚úÖ Total proposed % = 100%
- ‚úÖ Each percentage > 0%
- ‚úÖ No pending requests for vehicle
- ‚úÖ Reason: 10-1000 characters

**Approval:**
- ‚úÖ Approver must be co-owner
- ‚úÖ Request status = Pending
- ‚úÖ Approver hasn't responded yet
- ‚úÖ Comments ‚â§ 500 characters

**Cancellation:**
- ‚úÖ Only proposer can cancel
- ‚úÖ Request status = Pending

### **Automatic Application**
When all approvals received:
```csharp
foreach (var detail in changeRequest.OwnershipChangeDetails)
{
    vehicleCoOwner.OwnershipPercentage = detail.ProposedPercentage;
    vehicleCoOwner.InvestmentAmount = detail.ProposedInvestment;
    vehicleCoOwner.UpdatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;
}
```

---

## üîî Notification System

### **Notification Types**

**1. OwnershipChangeProposed**
- Sent to: All co-owners (except proposer)
- When: Proposal created
- Data:
```json
{
  "ownershipChangeRequestId": 1,
  "vehicleId": 5,
  "vehicleName": "VinFast VF8",
  "licensePlate": "30A-12345",
  "proposerName": "Nguyen Van A",
  "reason": "Ownership adjustment...",
  "yourCurrentPercentage": 50.0,
  "yourProposedPercentage": 40.0
}
```

**2. OwnershipChangeApproved**
- Sent to: All co-owners
- When: All approvals received
- Data:
```json
{
  "ownershipChangeRequestId": 1,
  "vehicleId": 5,
  "vehicleName": "VinFast VF8",
  "licensePlate": "30A-12345",
  "approved": true,
  "respondedBy": "Tran Thi B"
}
```

**3. OwnershipChangeRejected**
- Sent to: All co-owners
- When: Any co-owner rejects
- Data: Same as approved but `approved: false`

---

## üé¨ Use Cases

### **Case 1: Two Co-owners Adjust Percentages**

**Scenario:**
- Vehicle: VinFast VF8 (30A-12345)
- Current: User A (50%), User B (50%)
- Proposed: User A (60%), User B (40%)
- Reason: User A made additional investment

**Steps:**
1. User A: `POST /api/ownership-change/propose`
   ```json
   {
     "vehicleId": 5,
     "reason": "I invested additional 100M VND for vehicle upgrades",
     "proposedChanges": [
       { "coOwnerId": 10, "proposedPercentage": 60.0, "proposedInvestment": 600000000 },
       { "coOwnerId": 11, "proposedPercentage": 40.0, "proposedInvestment": 400000000 }
     ]
   }
   ```
2. System: Sends notification to User B
3. User B: `POST /api/ownership-change/1/respond`
   ```json
   { "approve": true, "comments": "Agreed, thanks for the investment" }
   ```
4. System: Auto-applies changes, updates database
5. Result: User A now owns 60%, User B owns 40%

---

### **Case 2: Adding Third Co-owner**

**Scenario:**
- Current: User A (100%)
- Proposed: User A (50%), User B (30%), User C (20%)

**Steps:**
1. First: Add User B and C via existing "Add Co-owner" feature
2. Then: Use ownership change to adjust percentages
3. All 3 co-owners must approve

---

### **Case 3: Rejection Scenario**

**Scenario:**
- 3 co-owners: A, B, C
- User A proposes change
- User B approves
- User C rejects

**Result:**
- Request immediately marked "Rejected"
- Changes NOT applied
- All co-owners notified

---

## üîê Security & Authorization

### **Role-Based Access:**
- **CoOwner/Staff/Admin**: Can propose changes for vehicles they co-own
- **CoOwner/Staff/Admin**: Can approve/reject requests they're involved in
- **Admin/Staff**: View system statistics
- **Anyone**: Cannot view/approve requests for vehicles they don't co-own

### **Data Protection:**
- Co-owners can only propose changes for their vehicles
- Approvals validated against co-owner relationship
- Database cascade deletes maintain referential integrity
- All operations logged with timestamps

---

## ‚ö° Performance Considerations

### **Optimizations:**
1. **Eager Loading**: Uses `.Include()` to load related entities efficiently
2. **Indexes**: Added on vehicle_id, status_enum, user_id + approval_status
3. **Single Query**: Loads all related data in one database roundtrip
4. **Async Operations**: All methods async for non-blocking execution

### **Database Queries:**
- Proposal: ~5 queries (validate, create request, create details, create approvals, notify)
- Approval: ~2 queries (load request, update approval + check consensus)
- Auto-apply: ~1 query (batch update all VehicleCoOwner records)

---

## üß™ Testing

### **Test Scenarios:**

**1. Valid Proposal:**
```http
POST /api/ownership-change/propose
{
  "vehicleId": 5,
  "reason": "Adjusting after new investment",
  "proposedChanges": [
    { "coOwnerId": 10, "proposedPercentage": 60.0 },
    { "coOwnerId": 11, "proposedPercentage": 40.0 }
  ]
}
```
Expected: 201 Created

**2. Invalid Total (Not 100%):**
```http
POST /api/ownership-change/propose
{
  "vehicleId": 5,
  "reason": "Test",
  "proposedChanges": [
    { "coOwnerId": 10, "proposedPercentage": 60.0 },
    { "coOwnerId": 11, "proposedPercentage": 30.0 }
  ]
}
```
Expected: 400 Bad Request - TOTAL_PROPOSED_OWNERSHIP_MUST_EQUAL_100_PERCENT

**3. Approve Change:**
```http
POST /api/ownership-change/1/respond
{ "approve": true, "comments": "I agree" }
```
Expected: 200 OK

**4. Reject Change:**
```http
POST /api/ownership-change/1/respond
{ "approve": false, "comments": "I disagree" }
```
Expected: 200 OK - Request rejected

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**

**1. "VEHICLE_HAS_PENDING_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE_REQUEST"**
- Only 1 pending request allowed per vehicle
- Wait for current request to complete or cancel it

**2. "ALL_CO_OWNERS_MUST_BE_INCLUDED_IN_OWNERSHIP_CHANGE"**
- Must include all current co-owners
- Check `GET /api/vehicle/{id}` for current co-owners

**3. "TOTAL_PROPOSED_OWNERSHIP_MUST_EQUAL_100_PERCENT"**
- Sum of all proposed percentages must = 100%
- Check decimal precision

**4. "NOT_AUTHORIZED_TO_APPROVE_THIS_REQUEST"**
- User is not a co-owner of the vehicle
- Check co-owner relationship

---

## üìä Monitoring

### **Metrics to Track:**
- Pending requests count
- Average approval time
- Approval vs rejection ratio
- Number of cancelled requests
- Active vehicles with ownership changes

### **Logs:**
```
[INFO] Ownership change request 1 created for vehicle 5 by user 15
[INFO] User 16 approved ownership change request 1. 1/2 approvals received
[INFO] Ownership change request 1 approved and applied
```
