In the Repositories project, after scaffolding the models and DbContext, you need to make the following changes:

- Replace the data type of the enum fields in the models with their respective enum type.
- Update the existing DbContext in the Context folder to accommodate the changes of the models' enum data type & the newly generated DbContext in the Models folder.
- Update other parts of the solution, including the DTOs, that reference the modified models, to ensure they are up to date with the models.
